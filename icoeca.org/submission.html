          <h3>Paper Submission</h3>

          <p>
            Prospective contributors are invited to submit full papers in DOC / DOCX / PDF format, with a maximum page length of <b>8 pages</b> in
            double column by including all the figures, tables, and references. The paper must adhere to the standard IEEE paper template, and no
            bibliography should be included at the conclusion. Papers that are not in accordance with the IEEE template by including appropriate
            reference/citation, or that exceed the page limit will not be processed to the next stage. Nevertheless, only the research articles that
            have neither appeared elsewhere for publication, nor are under review for another refereed conference publication will be considered. The
            study topic, primary research findings, and contributions should be clearly stated in the article.
          </p>

          <p class="alert bg-primary text-light">
            The full research paper should be only submitted to the conference email

            >
          </p>

          <p>
            When submitting a research paper, authors agree that if their work is accepted, they will submit a camera-ready version of the updated
            paper for inclusion in the final ICECA 2024 proceedings and will present the paper at the conference. By the time the camera-ready article
            is submitted for inclusion in the proceedings, each approved contribution must have one paid registration.
          </p>

          <p>
            The decision on the submitted manuscript will be sent to the authors via Email after the completion of review process. The acceptance ID
            given in the acceptance should be included in all the future conversations.

            Papers that are accepted will be allocated to a normal technical session. All articles will be subjected to a comprehensive, double-blind
            review procedure. In order to submit the final version, at least one author of an approved work must register for the conference. All
            accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore for publishing consideration.

          <p><b>Standard Conference Policies</b></p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              If a paper is not presented at the conference, ICECA reserves the right to remove it from dissemination after the meeting (for example,
              by not submitting it in IEEE Xplore). Papers are assessed on the criterion that they are not plagiarized and have not been submitted to
              another conference at the same time (multiple submissions).
            </li>

            <li>
              The conference can take any corrective or preventive action to publish the conference articles. The author is solely responsible for any
              post conference plagiarism and similarity issues.
            </li>

            <li>
              Authors are allowed to post their article in their personal website and institutional repositories. However, once accepted for
              publication in IEEE, the posted article must be removed from any other third-party servers.
            </li>

            <li>
              The author may not post the final published article online whereas it will be only available in IEEE Digital Xplore Library, which can
              be cited for any use.
            </li>

                <h4>Possible plagiarism scenarios</h4>
              </div>

              <div>
                <p>
                  Potentially complicating the effort to identify plagiarism is the fact that each of the above basic factors can be combined with
                  other factors, creating a range of possible plagiarism scenarios. Here, then, is a full list of possible scenarios, starting with
                  the worst case:
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Uncredited Verbatim Copying of a Full Paper, or Uncredited Verbatim Copying of a Major Portion (more than 50%) within a Single
                    Paper--An instance is where a large section of the original paper is copied without quotation marks, credit notice, reference, and
                    bibliography. This case also includes instances where different portions of a paper are copied without attribution from a number
                    of papers by other authors, and the sum of plagiarized material is more 50%, or<br /><br />Uncredited Verbatim Copying within More
                    than a Single Paper by the Same Author(s)--This includes instances where more than one paper by the offending author(s) has been
                    found to contain plagiarized content, and all the percentages of plagiarized material in each of the discovered papers sum to
                    greater than 50%.<br /><br />
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Uncredited Verbatim Copying of a Large Portion (greater than 20% and up to 50%) within a Paper.--An instance is where a section of
                    the original paper is copied from another paper without quotation marks, credit notice, reference, and bibliography. This case
                    also includes instances where different portions of a paper are copied without attribution from a number of papers by other
                    authors, and the sum of copying results in a large portion of plagiarized material (up to 50%) in the paper, or<br /><br />Uncredited
                    Verbatim Copying within More than One Paper by the Same Author(s)--This includes instances where the sum of plagiarized material
                    from the different papers would constitute the equivalent of a large portion (greater than 20% and up to 50%) of the discovered
                    paper with the fewest words.<br /><br />
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Uncredited Verbatim Copying of Individual Elements (Paragraph(s), Sentence(s), Illustration(s), etc.) Resulting in a Significant
                    Portion (up to 20%) within a Paper--An instance could be where portions of original paper are used in another paper without
                    quotation marks, credit notice, reference, and bibliography.<br /><br />
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Uncredited Improper Paraphrasing of Pages or Paragraphs. Instances of improper paraphrasing occur when only a few words and
                    phrases have been changed or when the original sentence order has been rearranged; no credit notice or reference appears with the
                    text.<br /><br />
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Credited Verbatim Copying of a Major Portion of a Paper without Clear Delineation. Instances could include sections of an original
                    paper copied from another paper; credit notice is used but absence of quotation marks or offset text does not clearly reference or
                    identify the specific, copied material.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <div></div>
            </div>

                <h4>Plagiarism, in short</h4>
              </div>

              <div>
                <p>
                  The extreme and more obvious cases notwithstanding, the above scenarios provide us with some basic determining factors we can use
                  when attempting to deal with allegations of plagiarism between authors.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Amount or quantity does not play a part in defining plagiarism. However, the amount of material plagiarized should play an
                    important part in determining the appropriate corrective action.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Credit notices or references are not sufficient to deflecting a charge of plagiarism if quotation marks or offset text have not
                    been used to identify the specific material being copied.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Paraphrasing can leave an author open to a charge of plagiarism if he or she has changed only a few words or phrases or has only
                    rearranged the original sentence order. Even a proper paraphrasing of the original text can lead to a charge of plagiarism if the
                    original source is not properly cited.
                  </li>
                </ul>
