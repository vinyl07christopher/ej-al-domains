        <p><strong>Review Process:</strong></p>
        <p>
          ICOSEC 2023 provides peer review for all the material submitted, wherein some of the submissions are rejected without being sent out for
          external review on the grounds of insufficient research content, originality and scientific flaws. A reject decision on such papers is taken
          quickly, usually within 1-2 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remaining manuscripts will be evaluated by two reviewers and by the anonymous expert member of the conference review committee, usually
          within 2-3 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the comments/suggestion from reviewers were received final decision concerning the publishing is made by the conference chair and the
          decision of acceptance/revision will be communicated via Email to the corresponding author.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Presentation Instructions:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Presentations should be clearly structured and should contain the essential elements of the accepted formal paper. Please include such
          content as problem statement, proposed/innovative approach, results, and any comparative evaluation that the author wishes to present. The
          presenter should prepare a reasonable number of PowerPoint slides, so as not to exceed the time limit.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Presentation duration: </strong>15 minutes + 5 minute Q&amp;A</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Important IEEE Policy Announcement</strong></p>
        <p>
          All papers submitted to ICOSEC 2023 will be checked for plagiarism via the IEEE CrossCheck system. If a paper results with a high similarity
          (including self-plagiarism), the paper may not be reviewed and automatically rejected. Note that even if a paper is accepted and paid for
          registration, the program committee has a right to reject the paper and will not publish the paper in the proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the
          same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE will take action against any author who has engaged in
          either practice.
        </p>
