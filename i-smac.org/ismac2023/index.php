      <h3>Scope</h3>

      <p>
        Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel Internet-based information architecture that may be used to improve the information flow in worldwide
        information networks. IoT simplifies how information is maintained if the devices have digital capabilities and can be detected and monitored
        automatically. The role of IoT in information management has become more significant, including integrated systems and networking, security,
        automation systems, architecture, and technologies based on IoT. As IoT has an influence on global information networks, numerous innovative
        prospects for applying IoT to information management may be anticipated in the near future. The International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in
        Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) is the premier forum to share and discuss the cutting edge research works in all areas of Internet of
        Things [IoT]. ISMAC 2023 focuses on exploring the application of IoT in different situations by discussing different challenges and issues
        such as efficiency in communication and collaboration, security and privacy, quality of services and problem predictions, network dynamic
        adaptations, network protocols and architectures, frameworks and distributed applications for coordinating connected devices and so on.

  <h3>About Purwanchal Campus</h3>
  <p>
    Purwanchal Campus formerly known as Eastern Region Campus (ERC) is one of constituent campus of Tribhuvan University (TU) and one of the associate
    engineering campuses of Institute of Engineering (IOE) which is a comprehensive, non-profit making, autonomous institution and pioneering
    institution of higher education level in Nepal funded by the government of Nepal. It is situated at Gangalal Marg, Tinkune, Dharan-8, Sunsari
    district in the eastern region of Nepal. It occupies areas of 34-13-11.75 Bigahas in convenient unit, which is equivalent to about 234,870.53
    square meters. It is adjacent to Charkose Jhadi (densely forest) in the north and located at entrance gate by bus of Dharan Sub-metropolitan city.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was established in Paush, 2034 BS (1976) under the loan agreement with Asian Development Bank (ADB). In another agreement with government of
    United Kingdom (UK) held in Shrawn, 2035BS (1978), the technical assistance was provided by the government of United Kingdom (UK). ERC was
    formally organized under Institute of Engineering (IOE), Tribhuvan University (TU) and all the construction works were completed in 2043 BS
    (1984).
  </p>

  <p>
    The campus firstly started trade level courses in Mechanical, Electrical and Civil engineering streams as specified in the loan and the project
    agreements. The programs in Diploma in Mechanical, Electrical, Civil Engineering (3 years) was started since 2043 BS (1984) and also Refrigeration
    & Air-conditioning Engineering program in 2052 BS, Computer and electronics engineering program in 2059 BS. In the attempt to further up
    gradation, IOE/ Purwanchal Campus introduced Bachelor level course that was Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Agricultural Engineering in 2057 BS
    (2000) which was first and pioneer in the country. Another BE program in Civil Engineering was commenced from 2061 BS (2004).
  </p>

  <p>
    The campus was also conducted under Council for Technical Education & Vocational Training (CTEVT) since 2045/11/12 (BS) by the mandate of
    Government of Nepal and later again came back and run under IOE/ TU since 2047/2/15 BS.

    Engineering, it was started another programs in Electronics & communication Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering in 2069
    (BS) and Electrical Engineering in 2071 (BS) and new program BE in Architecture in 2072 (BS). Till now there are seven BE engineering programs
    running in the campus and all trade level courses, three years diploma engineering programs was phased out as per policy of IOE/TU which was
