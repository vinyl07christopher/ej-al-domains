  <h4>Ethical Requirements</h4>

  <p>
    Following ethical guidelines is required in scientific publishing. Understand IEEE&rsquo;s publishing guidelines and concepts to ensure
    ethical requirements are met. Learn about authorship, how to cite sources appropriately, plagiarism, how to report your data accurately,
    and the importance of publishing original research.

  <h4><strong>Definition of Authorship</strong></h4>

  <p>
    Who should be listed as an author on your paper? The IEEE definition of authorship will help you answer that question and clarify each
    author&rsquo;s responsibilities.
  </p>

  <p>IEEE considers individuals who meet&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;of the following criteria to be authors:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical development, system or experimental design, prototype development,
      and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the work contained in the paper.
    </li>

    <li>Contributed to drafting the paper or reviewing and/or revising it for intellectual content.</li>

    <li>Approved the final version of the paper as accepted for publication, including references.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Contributors who do not meet all of the above criteria may be included in the Acknowledgment section of the paper. Omitting an author
    who contributed to your paper or including a person who did not fulfill all of the above requirements is considered a breach of
    publishing ethics.

  <h4>Proper Citation Practices</h4>

  <p>
    You can improve research reproducibility with proper citation practices. Always cite your sources.&nbsp;Citation is required in several
    instances. Follow these guidelines:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Direct quotation:&nbsp;</strong>Place verbatim text from another source in quotation marks. Indent text for longer quotes.
      Include a citation to the original source.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Paraphrase or summary:&nbsp;</strong>Include a citation when restating or summarizing information from another source,
      including ideas, processes, arguments, or conclusions.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Data, research results, information, graphics, or tables:&nbsp;</strong>Cite the original source when referring to, adapting,
      or reusing any information from another source.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that the same rules apply to your own previously published work. When in doubt, include a citation.</p>

  <h4><strong>Inappropriate Use of Citations</strong></h4>

  <p>
    Citing an irrelevant source for the purpose of artificially inflating citation metrics is considered a breach of ethics. Only cite
    relevant sources that legitimately contribute to your paper according to the criteria outlined above.
  </p>

  <a name="m_-8109289627162079155_m_615488341693215190_plagiarism"></a>

  <h4>What Is Plagiarism?</h4>

  <p>
    Learn how to avoid plagiarism. IEEE defines plagiarism as the use of another&rsquo;s ideas, processes, results, or words without
    explicitly acknowledging the original author and source.
  </p>

  <p>
    Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and is considered a serious breach of professional conduct, with potentially severe ethical and
    legal consequences (<a

  <h4><strong>Publish Original Research</strong></h4>

  <p>When submitting your paper for publication, it should:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Contain original research that has not been published before.</li>

    <li>Not be submitted to any other publication while you await a peer review decision.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    IEEE recognizes that technical research often follows an evolutionary publishing process. For example, research may be published first
    as a conference paper with preliminary findings, and then as a journal article with fully developed research and conclusions. IEEE
    supports this process provided that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The paper undergoes standard peer review every time it is submitted to a conference or publication.</li>

    <li>The later version of the article contains substantially more technical information than the earlier version.</li>

    <li>The later version cites the earlier version and clearly indicates how the two versions differ.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><strong>Report Data Accurately</strong></h4>

  <p>
    Readers of your paper rely on you to communicate your research findings fully and report your data accurately. Ensure you are showing
    the full picture by avoiding fabrication, falsification, and image manipulation during your research and when you are writing or
    revising your paper.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>Avoid:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fabrication: Inventing data or results.</li>

    <li>Falsification: Manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results&sup1;.</li>

    <li>Image manipulation: Excessive or inappropriate adjustment of an image that alters the scientific meaning of the image.</li>
  </ul>
