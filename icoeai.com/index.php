    <h3>Welcome to <span class="text-danger">ICEAI 2023</span></h3>

    <p>
    In recent years, evolutionary computation has been extensively utilized to find effective solutions to a wide range of computationally difficult problems for which ad hoc heuristics may not exist. Novel nature-inspired algorithms have been introduced and it is also effectively applied to real-world challenges with the advent of evolutionary algorithms. As a subfield of computational intelligence, evolutionary artificial intelligence uses computational models of evolutionary processes as the key element in design and implementation. Many evolutionary computational models have been proposed, including evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming and swarm intelligence. These techniques form the basis of several emerging disciplines like artificial life and evolutionary robotics. Despite the fact that the area is well-established and has reached a mature level of growth, significant research breakthroughs are presented every year by either suggesting new approaches or enhancing certain elements of well-known algorithms. This International Conference on Evolutionary Artificial Intelligence [ICEAI 2023] intends to be a major forum for engineers and research practitioners interested in the study, design, analysis, modeling and implementation of evolvable systems both theoretical and application fields. ICEAI 2023 also aims to foster hybrid approaches within evolutionary computation by integrating fuzzy computation and neural computation technologies.

  <h3>About the  <span class="text-danger">Taylor’s University</span></h3>
<p>Taylor’s vision for the future has always been clear: achieving balanced excellence, being recognised as a leading private university locally and globally, and equipping students to graduate in demand.</p>

<p>We are humbled by the recent recognition as the No. 1 Private University in Southeast Asia for three consecutive years. Leaping 349 ranks since 2019 to #284 in the QS World University Rankings 2023, we are now placed among the top 1% of the most influential universities globally. We are also ranked at #49 in Asia according to the QS Asia University Rankings 2023, leaping 40 places in just two years and over 140 places throughout the past seven years.</p>

<p>These successes are a testament to our commitment in providing quality education for our students. More importantly, the honour belongs not just to us, but to the entire Taylor’sphere™ community, encompassing dedicated lecturers and researchers, our industry partners, alumni, and most of all, our students and their parents. </p>

<p>Taylor’s is more than just a benchmark in education excellence. For the past 50 years, it is where Taylorians hone and perfect their unique strengths to create life-changing discoveries, breakthroughs and trends.</p>

<p>This holistic approach to education, paired with state-of-the-art facilities and a network of inspiring Taylorians have seen graduates making headlines in Malaysia and the world over.</p>
