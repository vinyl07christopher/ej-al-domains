    <h3>Welcome to <span class="text-dark">ICTSM 2023</span></h3>

    <p>
      In this digital era, the world is heading towards intelligent machines, which are expected to be as intelligent as people; Machine Intelligence.
      Researchers and scientists are striving to make smart machines that are sophisticated enough to automate the entire system. Machine learning is
      widely adopted as a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. In recent times, Machine learning offers a wide range of
      applications, including healthcare, security, agriculture and even in day-to-day applications. On the other hand, Machine learning plays a
      significant role in sustainable computing. The increasing adoption of machine learning intelligence and even its exponentially increasing
      consequences on various markets need a detailed examination of its implications for achieving long-term innovation success. This International
      Conference on Trends in Sustainable Computing and Machine Intelligence [ICTSM 2023] welcomes papers on broad aspects of AI, machine learning and
      sustainable computing that constitute advances in various real-time applications. ICTSM 2023 aims to report the novel results achieved in
      addition to proposals for developing new perspectives on Machine Intelligence [MI] and computing problems, both of which should include
      demonstrations of real-time value and effectiveness. Papers detailing the applications of MI and computing are also accepted, although the
      emphasis should be on how the novel and innovative MI and sustainable approaches enhance the performance in application domains, rather than
      presenting another application of established methods. The submitted papers should explain a novel solution, originality, and provide an
      in-depth review of the technique.
