    <h4>Scope</h4>

    <p>
      The current advances in technologies require sustainable networking and computing models to meet the growing demand of emerging indispensable
      ICT applications such as smart cities, entertainment, business, healthcare etc. On the other hand, data intelligence and communication plays a
      critical role in sustainable computing, especially the size of the data is beyond the ability of commonly used computing platforms for
      capturing, managing, and processing the data. Recent breakthroughs in data mining, data modelling, data processing, and artificial intelligence
      are seeking applications in energy networks to build a more sustainable environment. As the opportunities and challenges co-exist in both the
      fields, this 3<sup>rd</sup> International Conference of Sustainable Computing and Data Communication Systems [ICSCDS 2024] provides a platform
      to initiate research discussions in all the aspects including theoretical studies, real-time applications, and experimental prototypes.
      Moreover, ICSCDS 2024 focuses on the intelligent data processing, analysis, and understanding that support sustainable environments.
